Python scripts for controlling Minecraft Pi Edition on Raspberry Pi, as highlighted at mcpipy.com

This is a collection of python scripts that can be used to control Minecraft Pi Edition running on Raspberry Pi, or alternatively on a CraftBukkit server using the RaspberryJuice plugin.

Most (if not all) of the scripts are NOT of my own creation, but rather were created by others and collected to make it easy for others to enjoy them.  The scripts are unmodified with a few exceptions:

1. A comment was added near the top of each file noting the author and original URL where it was posted.
2. The mcpi python libraries are assumed to be in the "mcpi" folder and require this as a prefix to import.  As needed, scripts are updated to comply with this.
3. Minor formatting/bug fixing may be done to make the script run.

Thanks to everyone who has written with the scripts and I hope you enjoy it!

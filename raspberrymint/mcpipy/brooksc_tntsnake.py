# This script will:
# 1. Create a snake that will pick a random direction.
# if max_direction is set to 3, it will go backward/forward/left/right.  Set to 5 and it goes up/down.
# 2. Head in that direction for a random # of blocks from min_distance and max_distance
# leave a 5 block "plus" of TNT in it's path
# 3. Pick a new direction and go in that direction
# It should not double back on itself or go the same direction...

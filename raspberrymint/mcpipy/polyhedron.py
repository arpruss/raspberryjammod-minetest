# Python code to find the crossing point of two lines.

# This function is optimised for big-integer or FP arithmetic: it
# multiplies up to find two big numbers, and then divides them. So
# if you use it on integers it will give the most accurate answer
# it possibly can within integers, but might overflow if you don't
# use longs. I haven't carefully analysed the FP properties, but I
# can't see it going _too_ far wrong.
#
# Of course there's no reason you can't feed it rationals if you
# happen to have a Rational class. It only does adds, subtracts,
# multiplies, divides and tests of equality on its arguments, so
# any data type supporting those would be fine.

        # [0,2*pi]; phi (latitude) must be chosen in such a way that
        # the probability of falling within any given band of latitudes
        # must be proportional to the total surface area within that
        # band. In other words, the probability _density_ function at
        # any value of phi must be proportional to the circumference of
        # the circle around the sphere at that latitude. This in turn
        # is proportional to the radius out from the sphere at that
        # latitude, i.e. cos(phi). Hence the cumulative probability
        # should be proportional to the integral of that, i.e. sin(phi)

        # zero at -pi/2 and 1 at +pi/2, this tells us it has to be
